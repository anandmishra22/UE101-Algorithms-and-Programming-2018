# UE101-Algorithms-and-Programming-2018
I am co-teaching UE101-Algorithms-and-Programming to undergrads<br>
at Indian Institute of Science with Dr. Sathish G. and Dr. Viraj Kumar.
I offered five lectures for this course and co-ordinated labs for the
two weak. I covered primarily data structure part (ADTs, stack, queue,
binary tree, and BST).

<b>Lecture plans </b><br><br>

<b>Lecture-0: Introduction to DSA (By Dr. Sathish G.)
 Brief overview of algorithm, time complexity, and stack/queues. 
  -- Oct 10, 2018</b> <br>

Text book: Mark Allen Weiss (Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis
using C)

Binary Tree - 1 (Date: 15/10/2018)
-----------------------------------------------------
Covered: preliminaries of tree, like root, leaf, internal nodes, parent, sibling,
ancestor, successor, height of tree, degree of nodes in tree, depth (level)
of nodes in a tree. Applications of tree. We also covered about Complete
Binary Tree, Full Binary Tree, Perfect Binary tree and their properties.
Section - 4.1 and 4.2

Binary Tree - 2 (Date: 17/10/2018)
--------------------------------------------------
Covered: learnt how to compute (i) number of internal and leaf nodes in a
perfect binary tree, and relation between them, i.e., number of leaf nodes
in a binary tree is greater or equal to number of internal nodes, etc ,
(ii) height of perfect binary tree using induction.
Section - 4.1 and 4.2

Lab-1 (Date: 22/10/2018-25/10/2018)
------------------------------------------------------
BST construction, traversal (recursive), height of the tree, binary search
procedure


Binary Tree  - 3 and BST - 1: (Date: 22/10/2018)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tree walk/traversal: preorder, postorder, inorder, level-order,
Dictionary: Ordered, unordered,
BST:  Definition, Insertion, search
Section 4.2, 4.3.4

BST-2: (Date: 24/10/2018)
------------------------------------------------
BST: procedures for finding successor, min, max, and delete a node,
and their correctness
Section 4.3.3, 4.3.5

ADT (Date: 26/10/2018)
-------------------------------------
Abstract data type: stack , queue
Section-3.1, 3.3, 3.4

Lab-2 (Date: 29/10/2018 to 03/02/2018)
---------------------------------------------------------
(ii) Finding minimum in a BST, successor of a node, deleting node in
BST, (I) Non-recursive implementation of level order (using queue) and
preorder traversal (using stack).
